# mean-basic
This is a really simple web-app to learn the basics of the MEAN stack. The app is almost entirely identical to Arvind Ravulavaru's tutorial here - http://thejackalofjavascript.com/mean-stack-hands-on-tutorial/. Big thanks to Arvind for putting together a succinct yet easy-to-understand tutorial!
